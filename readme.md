# COMP3432 Spring 2025 – Matrix Multiplier Project

## 📝 Summary

This project involves implementing **single-threaded** and **multi-threaded** matrix multiplication in Java. The goal is to efficiently multiply large square matrices using concurrency concepts while optimizing memory usage.

---

## ✅ Deliverables

The following items **must be submitted** in a single `.zip` or `.rar` archive:

- `MatrixMultiplier_SingleThread.java`
- `MatrixMultiplier_MultiThread.java`
- `matrix_benchmark_results.csv` (auto-generated by script)
- Final Report in PDF format (based on the provided `.docx` template)

## 📂 Files in the Project

### Java Files

#### `MatrixMultiplier_SingleThread.java` – ❌ Incomplete

**Missing:**
- `MATRIX_SIZE` declaration.
- Matrix multiplication logic (`A x B = C`).
- Timing logic (`System.currentTimeMillis()` before/after computation).
- `duration` variable declaration and usage.
- `loadMatrixA(String filePath)` implementation.
- `loadMatrixB(String filePath)` implementation.

**To Do:**
- Read both matrices from file.
- Multiply matrices using a **single thread**.
- Time the process and print duration.

---

#### `MatrixMultiplier_MultiThread.java` – ❌ Incomplete

**Missing:**
- `MATRIX_SIZE` and `NUM_THREADS` declarations.
- Matrix multiplication logic with threads.
- `duration` variable.
- `loadMatrixB(String filePath)` implementation.
- `readMatrixARows()` inside `Worker` class.
- Complete implementation of `Worker` class (must extend `Runnable`).

**To Do:**
- Load Matrix B once in memory (shared among threads).
- Read specific rows from Matrix A for each thread.
- Use threads to compute parts of the result matrix.
- Join threads and measure elapsed time.
- Print time taken.

---

## 🚫 Constraints

- Use only `Thread` class or `Runnable` interface.
- Do **NOT** use `Callable`, `Future`, `ExecutorService`, or other high-level concurrency APIs.
- Must be completed in **groups of two students**.
- File I/O and thread structure must match the provided runner scripts.

## 🏃 Running the Benchmark

Run the script depending on your OS:

```bash
# For Linux / macOS
chmod +x run_matrix_benchmark.sh
